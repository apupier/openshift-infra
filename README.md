# Instructions to install OpenShift and Cloud Native Features

This project details prerequisites and steps required to prepare the machine / environment to 
become a Cloud Development Platform using as foundation - Linux Container and OpenShift as the
orchestration and management platform of the containers.

The documentation has been designed around the following topics 

- Become a Docker machine
- Next, to provision OpenShift and
- Finally to turn it on into a Cloud Native Developer Box !

## Become a Docker Machine

### Mac OSX

As the MacOS operating system doesn't support natively `Linux container`, it is then required to run a `Linux` vm using either `Virtualbox` or `Xhyve` as
hypervisor able to manage virtual machine locally.

Different tools, approaches exist to turn your mac into a `Containerized` platform and they are presented hereafter.

#### Docker machine

Docker machine is a client Tool communicating with the `Virtualbox` hypervisor and able to manage Linux VMs.
Using docker-machine commands, you can start, inspect, stop, and restart a managed host, upgrade the Docker client and daemon, and configure a Docker client to talk to your host.

- Why or when to use it ? 
  - For linux container development and testing
  - To bootstrap `OpenShift` using the `oc cluster up` command. This approach is not recommended and the [Minishift tool]() should then be used for that purpose.

- Prerequisites 
  * [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

- Follow installation instructions for Docker machine at https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/ or execute the following commands
  within a terminal. 
  
  **WARNING**: Change the version of the `docker-machine` according to the latest version published [here](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/)

  ```bash
  base=https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.14.0 &&
  curl -L $base/docker-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) >/usr/local/bin/docker-machine &&
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
  ```

- Alternatively, if you prefer to install `Docker` using the docker package that you can download from [here](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg), then the following tools including docker machine
  will be also installed :
  - Docker client
  - Docker compose
  - Docker machine
  - Docker credential osxkeychain

- To verify, validate if docker machine works with Virtualbox, then execute this command to create a vm named `default` using a lightweight linux distribution - [boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker) 

  ```bash
  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
  ```

#### Vagrant

Vagrant is a Ruby tool for building and managing Linux virtual machine environments. It offers more flexibility than `docker machine` as you can select the Linux OS that you would like to run locally, 
can work with different hypervisors and can better automate the process to bootstrap a Linux vm, configure it and execute post installations tasks. 

- Prerequisites 
  * [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  * [Vagrant](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.4/vagrant_2.0.4_x86_64.dmg)
  
- Why or when to use it ? 
  - To select the Linux OS to be tested
  - To customize your Linux vm with your needed/requested packages
  
- How To
 
1. Configure a private network between the guest and the host

   This private network will be used between your machine and the Linux vm and will let you to ssh to it
   
   ```
   vboxmanage hostonlyif create
   vboxmanage hostonlyif ipconfig vboxnet0 --ip 192.168.99.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0
   vboxmanage dhcpserver add --ifname vboxnet0 --ip 192.168.99.20 --netmask 255.255.255.0 --lowerip 192.168.99.50 --upperip 192.168.99.50
   vboxmanage dhcpserver modify --ifname vboxnet0 --enable
   ```

2. Create a Vagrant file

  ```
  cat > Vagrantfile << 'EOF'
  Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
    config.vm.box = "centos/7"
  
    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v, override|
      v.name = "centos-7-docker"
      v.memory = 6144
      v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", "4"]
      v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
    end
    
    # Add private network
    config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.99.50"
    
    # Execute post installation
    config.vm.provision :shell, path: "post-installation.sh"
  end    
  EOF
  ```
  
3. Create a bash script containing the commands to be executed to install docker and condigure it
  ```
  mkdir vagrant-centos && vagrant-centos
  
  cat > post-installation.sh << 'EOF'
  #!/bin/bash
  
  echo "Install docker, wget packages"
  sudo yum install -y git docker wget python-rhsm-certificates
  
  echo "Configure docker"
  sudo bash -c "cat > /etc/docker/daemon.json" << 'EOFILE'
    {
      "insecure-registries" : [ "172.30.0.0/16" ],
      "hosts" : [ "unix://", "tcp://0.0.0.0:2376" ]
    }
  EOFILE
  
  echo "Start and enable docker service"
  sudo groupadd docker
  sudo usermod -aG docker vagrant
  sudo systemctl enable docker
  sudo systemctl start docker
  
  sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
  EOF
  ```  

4. Start Vagrant VM
  ```
  vagrant plugin install ssh
  vagrant up
  ```

5. ssh to the vm
  ```
  vagrant ssh
  ```  
  
### Linux

For Linux native operating system, it is not by default required to use a hypervisor and then `docker` can be installed directly using 
the corresponding package.

- CentOS/Fedora

1. Install Atomic docker package (if not yet done):

    ```bash
    yum install docker
    systemctl enable docker
    systemctl start docker
    ```

2. Edit the file “/etc/docker/daemon.json” to specify the IP Address and the PORT on which the server can be access from the HOST:

   ```json
   {
   "insecure-registries" : [ "172.30.0.0/16" ],
   "hosts" : [ "unix://", "tcp://0.0.0.0:2376" ]
   }
   ```

3. Define the `DOCKER_HOST` env var within the HOST machine

   ```bash
   export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://ETHERNET_IP_ADDRESS:2376
   ```

- Ubuntu

1. Follow installation instructions for Docker CE at https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
2. Create the following file (and directories, if necessary)

   ```
   /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/overlay.conf
   [Service]
   ExecStart=
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2376 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --label provider=generic --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16
   Environment=
   ```

3. Run the following commands
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

## Provision OpenShift

As different tools / bootstrapping methods are available and serve different purposes to install `OpenShift`, the following table 
summarize and present the possibilities offered:

| Option  | Cloud Provider      | Tool       | Run As               | ISO                    |  Hypervisor       |
| ------: | ------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | -----------------------| :---------------: |
| 1 | Local Machine       | MiniShift  | `oc cluster up`      | CentOS or boot2docker  | Xhyve, Virtualbox |
| 2 | Local Machine       | Ansible, oc    | `oc cluster up`      | CentOS                | Virtualbox        |
| 3 | Remote Public  - Hetzner   | Ansible    | `systemctl service`  | CentOS                | -                 |
| 4 | Remote Private - OpenStack | Ansible    | `systemctl service`  | CentOS                | -                 |

**NOTE**: 
- Excepted the `option 1` where the `Minishift` tool manages the whole process to create the vm and next install the docker server, the other `options` only require a Linux VM and Docker server.
- For `option 3 and 4`, the Linux VM must be accessible using `ssh`
- The `option 2, 3 & 4` can also performed using `fedora`, `rhel` or `ubuntu` operating system but they haven't been tested and will not be presented here.

### Local - MiniShift

This section explains how to provision OpenShift Origin 3.9.0 using `MiniShift`, a bare metal CentOS vm running a Docker daemon or with the help of a cloud provider - (In this case, [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/)), and the following additional projects:

- Fabric8 Launcher
- Ansible Service Broker
 
First, use the following bash script `bootstrap_vm.sh <image_cache_boolean> <ocp_version>`, which will create a `centos7` vm using the `xhyve` hypervisor.

Here is a summary of what the script will do:

- Create a MiniShift `demo` profile
- Git clone `MiniShift addons` repo to install the `ansible-service-broker`
- Enable/disable `MiniShift` cache (according to the `boolean` parameter)
- Install the docker images within the OpenShift registry, according to the ocp version defined
- Start `MiniShift` using the experimental features

```bash
cd minishift    
./bootstrap_vm.sh true 3.9.0
```

**NOTE** : The caching option can be used in order to export the docker images locally, which will speed up the bootstrap process next time you recreate the OpenShift virtual machine / installation.

**NOTE** : The user to use to access the OpenShift installation is `admin` with the password `admin`. This user has been granted the OpenShift Cluster Admin role.

**NOTE** : Once the virtual machine has been created, it can be stopped/started using the commands `minishift stop|start --profile demo`.

### Local - Virtualbox Hypervisor

This section explains how you can create a customized CentOS Generic Cloud `qcow2` image and repackage it as a `vmdk` file for Virtualbox.

#### MacOS's users only

As MacOS users can't execute natively all the linux commands, part of the different bash scripts, it is required to create a Linux vm on virtualbox:

- Create and start a vm on virtualbox
```bash
cd virtualbox/build-centos-iso
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant plugin install sshd
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

- Move to the `install` directory mounted into the vm by vagrant
```bash
cd install 
```

#### Common steps

In order to prepare the Centos VM for the cloud, we are using the [cloud-init](http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest) tool which is a set of python scripts and utilities to make your cloud images be all they can be! 

We will use this tool to install our Cloud on Virtualbox, with your own parameters such as:

- Network configuration (NAT, vboxnet),
- User : `root`, pwd : `centos`
- Additionally add non root user, user, password, ssh authorized key, 
- yum packages, ...


**Note** : Centos 7 ISO packages include version `0.7.9` of the `cloud-init` tool by default. 

To prepare your CentOS image (the `iso` file that Virtualbox will use to bootstrap your vm), you will have to execute the following script, which will perform the following tasks :

- Add your SSH public key within the `user-data` file using as input the `user-data.tpl` file 
- Package the files `user-data` and `meta-data` within an ISO file created using `genisoimage` application
- Download the CentOS Generic Cloud image and save it under `/LOCAL/HOME/DIR/images`
- Convert the `qcow2` Centos ISO image to `vmdk` file format
- Save the vmdk image under `/LOCAL/HOME/DIR/images`

Execute this bash script to repackage the CentOS ISO image and pass your parameters for `</LOCAL/HOME/DIR>` and the name of the Generic Cloud Centos file `<QCOW2_IMAGE_NAME>`, which the script downloads from `http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/`

```bash
cd virtualbox/build-centos-iso/cloud-init
./new-iso.sh </LOCAL/HOME/DIR> <QCOW2_IMAGE_NAME> <BOOLEAN_RESIZE_QCOQ_IMAGE>
```

Example:
```bash
./new-iso.sh /Users/dabou CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2c true

```

#### Create CentOS vm on VirtualBox

To automatically create a new Virtualbox VM using the customized CentOS ISO image (the `iso` file including the `cloud-init` config files), execute the following script `create_vm.sh` on the machine running VirtualBox. This script will perform the following tasks:

- Power off the virtual machine if it is running
- Unregister the vm `$VIRTUAL_BOX_NAME` and delete it
- Rename Centos `vmdk` to `disk.vmdk`
- Create `vboxnet0` network and set dhcp server IP : `192.168.99.50/24`
- Create Virtual Machine
- Define NIC adapters; NAT accessing internet and `vboxnet0` to create a private network between the host and the guest
- Customize vm; ram, cpu, ...
- Create IDE Controller, attach iso dvd and vmdk disk
- Start vm and configure SSH Port forward

```bash
cd virtualbox/build-centos-iso/cloud-init 
./create-vm.sh </LOCAL/HOME/DIR>
```
Example:
```bash
./create-vm.sh /Users/dabou
######### Poweroff machine if it runs

```

**Note** : VirtualBox will fail to unregister and remove the vm the first time you execute the script; warning messages will be displayed!

Test if you can ssh to the newly created vm using the private address `192.168.99.50`!
```bash
ssh root@192.168.99.50     
The authenticity of host '192.168.99.50 (192.168.99.50)' can't be established.

### Public Cloud Provider - Hetzner

See [hetzner](hetzner/README.md) page explaining how to create a cloud vm.

### Private Cloud Provider - Openstack

See

# Turn on your OpenShift machine into a Cloud Native Dev environment 

Independent of the approach you choose before, you'll be able to install or configure OpenShift
to play with the Hands On Lab, run local demos, or simply test one of the following features:

- Create list of users/passwords and their corresponding project
- Grant Cluster admin role to an OpenShift user 
- Set the Master-configuration of Openshift to use `htpasswd` as its identity provider
- Enable Persistence using `hotPath` as `persistenceVolume`
- Install Nexus Repository Server
- Install Jenkins and configure it to handle `s2i` builds started within an OpenShift project
- Install Distributed Tracing - Jaeger
- Install ServiceMesh - Istio
- Deploy the [Ansible Service Broker](http://automationbroker.io/)
- Install and enable the Fabric8 [Launcher](http://fabric8-launcher)

## Bash script (minishift only)

**NOTE**: Due to some limitations we are currently facing with `minishift|cdk`, where
we can't use Ansible Playbooks to provision our different features once OpenShift is installed, we will instead use 
bash script, manual `oc` commands or `Minishift` addons to install some of the features.  

We will then use the following bash script - `deploy_launcher_minishift.sh` instead to install the `Fabric8 launcher` and play with missions / boosters.
Using this script, you will have to specify your OpenShift account user/password and also your github user and API access token ([get an access token here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)).
This will enable you to use the `git flow` when running missions / boosters, rather than downloading boosters as zip files and deploying them manually.

```bash
cd minishift 
./deploy_launcher_minishift.sh -p projectName -i username:password -g myGithubUser:myGithubToken 

E.g ./deploy_launcher_minishift.sh -p devex -g myGithubUser:myGithubToken
```

## Ansible playbooks

See [Ansible post installation](ansible/README-post-installation.md) file to provision OpenShift with one of the Cloud Development features proposed.
