# Installation of OpenShift Cluster using Ansible Playbooks


Use the `README-VM` in the `ansible` directory for instructions on how to install Openshift on the created VM.
Keep in mind that the for the `generate_inventory` role of those instruction you need to use the following IP

`192.168.99.50`

which is the IP that is assigned to the VM when it's created by VirtualBox
