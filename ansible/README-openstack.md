# Install all in one Openshift Origin on Openstack

## Provision a Virtual Machine

The first thing that needs to be done is to provision a fairly large CentOS virtual machine top of the Cloud operating system Openstack.
This can of course be done via the OpenStack UI or can be automated using our Ansible openstack playbook like so:

`ansible-playbook playbook/openstack.yml -e '{"state": "present", "hostname": "somehostname", "openstack": {"os_username": "username", "os_password": "password", "os_auth_url": "https://somehost:13000/v3", "os_project_id": "someprojectid"}}'`

The playbook also uses the variables defined in `roles/openstack/defaults/main.yml`. Those variables can also be overriden using the syntax above.
For example to override the VM flavor, one would execute the following command:

`ansible-playbook playbook/openstack.yml -e '{"state": "present", "hostname": "somehostname", "openstack": {"os_username": "username", "os_password": "password", "os_auth_url": "https://somehost:13000/v3", "os_project_id": "someprojectid", "vm": {"flavor": "m1.medium"}}}'`

To delete a VM, simply replace `"state": "present"` with `"state": "absent"`

When using `"state": "present"`, the playbook will also generate an Openshift 3.9 inventory file in `inventory/cloud_host` 
as well as the private key of the new VM as `inventory/id_openstack.rsa` 

The openshift-ansible playbooks can now be launched like so:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/cloud_host openshift-ansible/playbooks/prerequisites.yml --become
ansible-playbook -i inventory/cloud_host openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy-playbook.yml --become
```

### Perform post installation tasks

The tasks defined in the `post_installation` role are available once the cluster is setup.
For example to grant cluster admin rights to the `admin` user and also change the admin user's password to `dummy` execute the following:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/cloud_host playbook/post_installation.yml --tags enable_cluster_admin,identity_provider -e openshift_admin_pwd=dummy --become
```
